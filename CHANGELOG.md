**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/EOPF-Explorer/data-model/compare/v0.7.1...v0.8.0

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- Simplified multiscale generation logic and improved data type handling by converting float64 outputs to float32 (#110)
- Enhanced multiscale processing to use zarr groups instead of file paths for improved I/O efficiency (#110)
- Consolidated test data structure by moving all test examples under unified `_test_data` directory (#105)
- Refined scale offset encoding behavior during multiscale data generation (#110)

### Fixed

- Fixed failing mock tests in multiscale generation pipeline (#110)
- Improved test fixture organization and removed redundant test data files (#105)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- Distributed job monitoring with proper Future status tracking when distributed client is available (#103)
- Post-write verification to catch silent write failures and invalid output datasets

### Changed

- Improved `stream_write_dataset` to use `client.compute()` for better status monitoring when distributed client is active
- Enhanced error reporting with specific failure context and dataset path information
- Added fallback mechanisms for distributed features when client is unavailable

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where CLI would not exit with error code when write operations failed silently

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- Spatial Zarr Convention models and metadata support (#100)

### Changed

- Updated multiscales metadata handling for improved compatibility
- Set up VCS versioning based on git tags for automatic version management
- Improved linting configuration by dropping isort and black in favor of stronger linting

### Fixed

- Prevented crash in quality-mask downsampling for Sentinel-2 processing
- Fixed S3 path test issues
- Improved runtime imports for better performance

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-04

### Added

- `eopf_geozarr.s2_optimization` module with streaming multiscale generation, CLI commands, and validation for Sentinel-2 L2A.
- End-to-end sharding support spanning CLI flags, conversion helpers, Dask execution, and encoding metadata.
- Geo Projection attribute extension documentation plus schema to lock GeoZarr metadata expectations.

### Changed

- Tightened spatial chunk and shard defaults to cut write overhead on large scenes.
- Relocated the entire test suite under `src/eopf_geozarr/tests` and broadened type coverage for tooling.
- Smoothed multiscale metadata handling during streaming writes to keep Sentinel datasets consistent.

### Fixed

- Preserved coordinate dtypes in overview levels and stopped auxiliary coordinate write failures.
- Prevented streaming metadata consolidation from overwriting existing groups between runs.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- Sentinel-1 GRD integration tests and CLI wiring to enforce GeoZarr compliance end to end.
- Reprojection utilities with GCP selection and grid-mapping output for Sentinel-1 converts.

### Changed

- Extended `create_geozarr_dataset` to understand VV/VH polarization groups and build GCP-backed overviews.
- Tuned chunk-size calculation and encoding helpers so shard dimensions and auxiliaries align.

### Fixed

- Stopped auxiliary coordinate writes from failing in overviews when chunked.
- Silenced noisy CLI warnings and aligned launch configs with the packaged tests.
