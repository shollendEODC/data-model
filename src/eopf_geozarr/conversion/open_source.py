"""Open source EOPF zarr stores with dask chunks aligned to native chunks.

With ``chunks="auto"``, dask may split one on-disk zarr chunk into several
read tasks that each fetch and decompress the same object key — multiplying
egress and racing on shared cache files (EOPF-Explorer/data-pipeline#339).
``open_source_datatree`` opens with ``chunks={}`` (the store's native chunk
grid), so each zarr chunk is read by exactly one dask task; downstream
conversion code rechunks to its own output encoding anyway. Note that one
task then materializes one whole native chunk (~241 MB raw for cpm_v270
aot/wvp) — under tight memory budgets, lower dask task concurrency rather
than sub-splitting stored chunks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Source store URL (local path, s3://, or https://).
    storage_options : dict, optional
        fsspec storage options. Defaults to ``get_storage_options(path)``
        (S3 credentials/endpoint for s3:// paths, None otherwise).
    cache_dir : str, optional
        Local directory for an on-disk read cache of source objects, backed
        by zarr's ``CacheStore`` over a ``LocalStore``. LocalStore writes are
        atomic (temp file + rename), so a concurrent read never sees a
        partially downloaded object. Entries are namespaced per source URL
        (CacheStore keys entries by relative zarr key, so different sources
        sharing a directory would otherwise collide) and never expire; use an
        ephemeral directory.
    engine : str
        xarray backend engine, default ``"zarr"``.

    Returns
    -------
    xr.DataTree
        Datatree whose dask arrays are chunked exactly on the store's native
        chunk grid: each on-disk zarr chunk is read by exactly one dask task.
